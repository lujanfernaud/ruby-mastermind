# Project: Mastermind in Ruby for The Odin Project
# Author: LujÃ¡n Fernaud
#
# Instructions:
#
# Build a Mastermind game from the command line where you have 12 turns to guess
# the secret code, starting with you guessing the computer's random code.
#
# 1. Think about how you would set this problem up!
#
# 2. Build the game assuming the computer randomly selects the secret colors
#    and the human player must guess them. Remember that you need to give
#    the proper feedback on how good the guess was each turn!
#
# 3. Now refactor your code to allow the human player to choose whether
#    she wants to be the creator of the secret code or the guesser.
#
# 4. Build it out so that the computer will guess if you decide to choose
#    your own secret colors. Start by having the computer guess randomly
#    (but keeping the ones that match exactly).
#
# 5. Next, add a little bit more intelligence to the computer player so that,
#    if the computer has guessed the right color but the wrong position,
#    its next guess will need to include that color somewhere.
#    Feel free to make the AI even smarter.
